# Image Viewer

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for : 
This project is $\color{green}{\textit{Image Viewer}}$ in Java language. In this Project, you can select a picture from a folder (which I put on my repository) and then there is a button to show the picture for you, and also you can make some changes on that picture. These changes include changing the brightness, resizing the picture and gray scaling the picture. There is also an exit button to exit the application.
